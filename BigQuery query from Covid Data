A  SQL query I wrote using Google's BigQuery to perform an exploratory data analysis on the covid dataset located here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The findings from this analysis was used to create a dashboard on tableau which can be accessed here : https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboard_17095732395740/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
